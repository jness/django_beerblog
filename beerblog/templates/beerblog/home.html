            <p>
            Nessy's Tavern was constructed in 2010 in Round Rock Texas.
            As a project designed to pass some time, a mere two
            weeks later the Tavern was completed. The bar comes equipped
            with a nine holding wine rack, and shelving for glassware.
            A keg-o-rator added to the mix, and we had a fully functional bar.
            </p>

            <p>
            The design and build process is documented via photograph
