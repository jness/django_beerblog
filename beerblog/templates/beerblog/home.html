            <p>
            Nessy's Tavern was constructed in 2010. A
            project designed to pass some time, a mere two
            weeks later the Tavern was completed.
            </p>

            <p>
            The bar comes equipped with a nine holding wine rack, and
            shelving for glassware.
            A keg-o-rator added to the mix, and we had a fully functional bar.
            </p>

            <p>
            The design and build process is documented via photograph
